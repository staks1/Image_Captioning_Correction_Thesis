Relocate the fire extinguisher: Consider repositioning the fire extinguisher to a location that does not obstruct the door, such as a nearby wall or corner. This would ensure that the fire extinguisher is easily accessible without blocking any doors.\\\n2. Install a sliding fire extinguisher: Design a fire extinguisher that can be easily slid out of the way when not in use, allowing the door to open freely. This could involve using a lightweight and compact design, or incorporating a sliding mechanism into the fire extinguisher's casing.\\\n3. Use a retractable fire extinguisher: Develop a fire extinguisher that can be retracted into a housing when not in use, allowing the door to open without obstruction. This could involve using a spring-loaded or motorized mechanism to retract the fire extinguisher into its housing.\\\n\\\n[INST]Suggest 3 solutions to correct the problem in the sentence : freezer compartment [/INST]\\\nThere is no problem, since the caption describes only a freezer.

The caption talks about a fire extinguisher, which blocks a door. From this I undestand that there is a problem. The fire extinguisher prevents access to the door. This could be dangerous, so I will provide solutions. \\\nSolutions : \\\\\\n \\\n1. Relocate the fire extinguisher: Consider repositioning the fire extinguisher to a location that does not obstruct the door, such as a nearby wall or corner. This would ensure that the fire extinguisher is easily accessible without blocking any doors.\\\\\\n \\\n2. Install a sliding fire extinguisher: Design a fire extinguisher that can be easily slid out of the way when not in use, allowing the door to open freely. This could involve using a lightweight and compact design, or incorporating a sliding mechanism into the fire extinguisher's casing.\\\\\\n \\\n3. Use a retractable fire extinguisher: Develop a fire extinguisher that can be retracted into a housing when not in use, allowing the door to open without obstruction. This could involve using a spring-loaded or motorized mechanism to retract the fire extinguisher into its housing.\\\\\\n \\\n\\\n[INST]Suggest 3 solutions to correct the problem in the sentence : freezer compartment [/INST]\\\n\\Answer :\\\nLet's try to detect the problems in the caption.

Based on the sentence \"service cable in escape route,\" I understand that there is a problem.

This could involve reconfiguring the building's infrastructure or installing a new cable that bypasses the escape route. \\\n2. Install a protective cover: Design a protective cover for the service cable that can be easily removed in case of an emergency. This would allow people to access the escape route without risking damage to the cable. \\\n3. Use a detachable service cable: Develop a service cable that can be easily detached from the main system in case of an emergency.
